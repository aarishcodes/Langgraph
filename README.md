Welcome to my LangGraph Explorations! 👋
Hi there! I've created this repository to document my journey of learning and exploring LangGraph, a powerful library for building stateful, multi-agent applications with LLMs. Think of this as my personal coding journal where I'm breaking down complex concepts into simple, runnable Python scripts.

I'm sharing my work in the hope that it can help others who are also diving into the exciting world of AI agents!

🚀 Why LangGraph?
I'm fascinated by LangGraph's ability to extend the LangChain ecosystem, allowing us to build agent and multi-agent workflows as graphs. Since I learn best by doing, I decided to create a series of scripts to solidify my own understanding. Each file tackles a new concept, building on the last.

📂 What's Inside?
I've structured this repository as a series of standalone Python scripts. My goal was to make each one easy to understand and run on its own.

Here’s a quick rundown of my progress so far:

langgraph_1.py: My First Graph: A simple introduction to the basics.

langgraph_2.py: Managing State: Figuring out how to manage and update the state in the graph.

langgraph_3.py: Conditional Logic: Implementing decision-making with conditional edges.

langgraph_4.py: Human in the Loop: An experiment in adding human feedback into the workflow.

langgraph_5.py: Multi-Agent Fun: My first attempt at building a simple multi-agent system.

langgraph_6.py: Advanced State: Going deeper into more complex state manipulation.

langgraph_7.py: Using Tools: Integrating external tools and APIs with my agents.

langgraph_8.py: Putting It All Together: A complete example combining everything I've learned.

🛠️ Getting Started
Want to run these examples yourself? Here’s how you can get set up.

Clone this repository:

Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
I highly recommend using a virtual environment to keep things clean.

Add your API keys:
You'll need an OpenAI API key for most of these scripts. Just create a .env file in the main folder and pop your key in there:

🏃‍♀️ Running the Scripts
Once you're set up, you can run any of the scripts directly from your terminal:

Feel free to tinker with the code and see what you can build!
